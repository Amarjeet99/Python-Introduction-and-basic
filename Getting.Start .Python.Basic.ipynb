    "* Python is easy to learn and use. It is developer-friendly and high level programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Expressive Language\n",
    "* Python language is more expressive means that it is more understandable and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Interpreted Language\n",
    "* Python is an interpreted language i.e. interpreter executes the code line by line at a time. This makes debugging easy and thus suitable for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4) Cross-platform Language\n",
    "* Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, Unix and Macintosh etc. So, we can say that Python is a portable language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5) Free and Open Source\n",
    "* Python language is freely available at offical web address.The source-code is also available. Therefore it is open source.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6) Object-Oriented Language\n",
    "* Python supports object oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7) Extensible\n",
    "* It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and thus it can be used further in our python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8) Large Standard Library\n",
    "* Python has a large and broad library and prvides rich set of module and functions for rapid application development.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9) GUI Programming Support\n",
    "* Graphical user interfaces can be developed using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10) Integrated\n",
    "* It can be easily integrated with languages like C, C++, JAVA etc."
